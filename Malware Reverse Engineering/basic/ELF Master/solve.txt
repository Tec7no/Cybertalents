1. This file seems corrupted all i remember that the entry point was at 0x1080 ,can you help me?
2. u have to figure out the entry point and it's seem to be 0x1080 
3. when u gonna check it's   "Entry point address:               0x0" using readelf .
4. so the idea here is to change the entery point to 0x1080 . 
5. using objcopy --set-start=0x1080 ./file ./file.new
6. excute the new file u gonna see the flag .
